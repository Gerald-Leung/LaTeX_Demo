In previous studies, main-sequence stars were thought not to contribute because they suffer from early tidal disruption. Here we show that according to our simulations of the stellar dynamics of the Sgr A* cluster, there must be one to a few low-mass main-sequence stars sufficiently bound to the central Galactic black hole to be conspicuous sources in LISA observations. The probability that a white dwarf may be detectable is lower than 0.5, and in spite of mass segregation, detection of a captured neutron star or stellar black hole in the center of the Milky Way is highly unlikely.}

References are given for all data listed. We have also developed a new World Wide Web interface for accessing and displaying either tabular or plotted data with the option of selecting pulsars to be displayed via logical conditions on parameter expressions. The Web interface has an "expert" mode giving access to a wider range of parameters and allowing the use of custom databases. For users with locally installed software and database on Unix or Linux systems, the catalog may be accessed from a command-line interface. C-language functions to access specified parameters are also available. The catalog is updated from time to time to include new information.}
